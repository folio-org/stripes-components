This component renders a set of filter-groups, each of which pertains to a searchable field and contains a set of filters that indicate values required for that field.


## Basic Usage

```js
const filterConfig = [
  {
    label: 'Item Types',
    name: 'item',
    cql: 'materialType',
    values: ['Books', 'DVDs', 'Microfilm'],
    restrictWhenAllSelected: true,
  }, {
    label: 'Location',
    name: 'location',
    cql: 'location.name',
    values: [
      { name: 'Library of Trantor', cql: 'trantor', hidden: true},
      { name: 'Main Library', cql: 'main' },
      'Annex Library'],
  },
];

this.state = {
  filters: initialFilterState(filterConfig, props.location.query.filters),
};

<FilterGroups config={filterConfig} filters={this.state.filters} />

const filterCql = filters2cql(filterConfig, filters);
```


## Overview

This library provides several utilities for initialising, rendering
and manipulating sets of filters, and deriving from them a query
expressed in CQL. The general approach is that a React component
declaratively specifies a set of filter groups, which is then uses in
several different contexts to drive different but related pieces of
code.

In order to make it easy to use without needing to make a lot of
decisions, this library is somewhat opinionated about state
representation. This state is set using a `transitionToParams` method,
and obtained using a `queryParam` method. These must both be provided
within the React component that uses `<FilterGroups>`.


### Filter configuration

The filter configuration is an array containing an ordered list of
filter groups. Each group is represented by an object with four keys:

* `label` -- The human-readable label that is used when presenting the
  group on a page.
* `name` -- The name used internally for the filter group, which may
  be short or opaque in meaning.
* `cql` -- The name of the CQL index that corresponds to the filter
  group, and which will be used in queries to find records that
  satisfy particular settings of the filters in the group. In general,
  this will be the name of a field, or maybe subfield, in the schema
  for the kind of records under consideration.
* `values` -- A list of the possible values that may be selected for
  the filter.
* `restrictWhenAllSelected` -- a boolean indicating how to behave when
  all the filters in the group are selected. By default, this is taken
  to mean no restriction is intended, and so that filter group makes
  no contribution to the query. However, if this is set true, then a
  query clause is always included. (See
  [STCOM-204](https://issues.folio.org/browse/STCOM-204) for
  rationale.)

Each of the `values` is typically represented by a simple string, which
is used both to display on the page and as the value to use in
queries. However, each value may optionally instead be an object
containing two keys:

* `name` -- the name used to display the filter on the page.
* `cql` -- the value used when generating CQL queries.
* `hidden` -- hide the value in the UI and always apply the filter

In the example above, there are two filter groups, "Item Types" and
"Location". All the values of the former are simple strings; one of
the values of the latter is of the more complex form, using "Main
Library" as the displayed value and just 'main' as the corresponding
value to use in searches. Additionally, the value with the name
"Library of Trantor", which has the attribute `hidden: true` will
not be exposed in the UI (i.e. there will not be a checkbox for it)
but it will _always_ be applied to the `location` filters. Think of it
as a hidden checkbox that is always checked.

Each filter value has a "full name", made up of the group name, a
period and the filter name itself. For example, in the configuration
above, the full names include `item.Books` and `location.Annex
Library`.

### Representation in the user-interface URL

The state of the filters is communicated back to the caller by
invoking its `transitionToParams` method to set the value of a single query
parameter, `filters`, whose value is a comma-separated list of the
full names of all selected filters. Typically, the caller's
`transitionToParams` method will set its values into the anointed
stripes-connect resource resulting in a change in the user-interface's
URL. For example:

	http://example.com/users?filters=item.DVDs,item.Microfilm,location.Main+Library


## The `filterState` function

This function takes as its parameter a comma-separated string of
filters' full names, such as `'item.DVDs,item.Microfilm,location.Main
Library'`. It returns an object whose keys are the full names and
whose values are all the boolean `true`.

It therefore maps between the URL representation of a set of filters
and the more programmatically accessible representation that must be
passed into the `<FilterGroups>` component:

	const filters = filterState(this.queryParam('filters'));
	return <FilterGroups ... filters={filters} />;

## The `<FilterGroups>` component

This component renders the full set of filter groups, with headings.

### Properties

The following properties are supported:

* `config` -- the configuration structure described above, which
  specifies which groups and filters to render.
* `filters` -- an objects whose keys are the full names of filters
  that are selected (i.e. the `filters` part of the component state).
* `onChangeFilter` -- a function that is invoked when one of the
  filters is clicked.

The change-filter handler function is the most awkward part of this
API. It must update the component state to represent the change in the
clicked filter's setting -- which is easy; but it must also transition
to a new URL that incorporates the modified filter state, and there is
no general way to do that without knowing about the component's other
state (e.g. query, sort-order).

So the function will always look _something_ like this:

	onChangeFilter(e) {
	  const filters = Object.assign({}, this.state.filters);
	  filters[e.target.name] = e.target.checked;
	  this.setState({ filters });
	  this.transitionToUrlReflectingFilters(filters);
	}

But the implementation of `transitionToUrlReflectingFilters` will vary
between applications.


## The `filters2cql` function

This function takes as its parameters the figure configuration
structure and a comma-separated string of filters' full names, such as
`'item.DVDs,item.Microfilm,location.Main Library'`.

It returns a string containing a CQL query corresponding to the
specified set of filters, such as
`materialType=("DVDs" or "Microfilm") and location.name="main"`. This
can be combined with other CQL fragments representing the component's
current query and sort-order to yield a full CQL query for the
component's entire state -- typically within a [path
function](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/blob/master/doc/api.md#functional-paths)
in a [Stripes Connect
manifest](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/blob/master/doc/api.md#the-connection-manifest).

The interpretation of the filters is as follows:

* Filter groups for which no item is selected play no role at all.
* The constraints of _all_ filter groups for which at least one item is
  selected must be satisfied.
* Each filter group is satisfied by records that have _any_ of the
  values specified in the filter.

In short, records are found if they match _any_ of the values for _all_ of
the non-empty groups.
