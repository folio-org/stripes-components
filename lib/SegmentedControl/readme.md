# Segmented Control
Creates a split button set that can be used for filters, tabs, and other subnavigation.

## Usage
`<SegmentedControl>` will accept one or more `<Button>` components as children. **Each child button should have its own unique `id` prop.**
```
import { SegmentedControl } from '@folio/stripes/components';
// ...
/* define a handler for activation.
* It should accept an object containing an 'id' key.
* This will be equal to the 'id' prop of the clicked/selected button
* from the control.
*/

  handleActivate({id}) {
    this.setState({
      activeTab: id,
    });
  }

// ...
<SegmentedControl activeId={this.state.activeTab} onActivate={this.handleActivate}>
  <Button id="test">test</Button>
  <Button id="it">it</Button>
  <Button id="out">out</Button>
</SegmentedControl>
```

Additionally, each child `<Button>` can have its own `onClick` handler as well for handing other functionality.
