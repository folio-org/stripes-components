## Passthrough value
Using the prop `passThroughValue` means that you expect a non-date string to be passed as a value, and want to use that to derive the time value that you do want submitted. An example of this would be to pass through "Today" and actually submit the current time (whenever the submit button is pressed.) "Today" can be set as an initial value, or the user can enter "Today".
```
<Field name="exampleDateReturned" label="Date returned" id="dateReturnDP" placeholder="Select Date" component={Datepicker} passThroughValue="Today"/>
```

## ignoreLocalOffset
If your date does not lean on time for validation (eg: Birthdates, that shouldn't change their value based on timezone), apply the "ignoreLocalOffset" prop to the datepicker, for it to use UTC in its produced value. For dates that lean on time (eg: expiryDate), ignore this prop.
