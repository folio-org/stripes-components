# AppIcon

Displays an app's icon in various sizes.

## Usage
AppIcon supports different ways of loading icons.

Option 1 is the recommended implementation but if needed (edge case) option 1 and 2 can be used.

***1. Use context (recommended)***
```js
  import AppIcon from '@folio/stripes-components/lib/AppIcon';

  // Note: Make sure that the AppIcon has "stripes" in context as it relies on stripes.metadata.
  <AppIcon app="users" size="small" />
  ```
  Optional: You can supply an iconKey if you need a specific icon within an app. If the specific icon isn't bundled with the app it will simply render a placeholder.
```js
  <AppIcon app="inventory" iconKey="holdings" />
```

***2. Supply an object to the icon prop***
```js
  const icon = {
    src: '/static/some-icon.png',
    alt: 'My icon',
    title: 'My icon',
  };

  <AppIcon icon={icon} />
  ```

***3. Pass img as child***
  ```js
  <AppIcon>
    <img src="/static/my-icon.png" alt="My icon" />
  </AppIcon>
```
