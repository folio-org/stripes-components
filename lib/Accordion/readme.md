# Accordion

Make parts of the UI collapsible using this component.

## Basic Usage

```
import { AccordionSet, Accordion } from '@folio/stripes-components/lib/Accordion';

...
<AccordionSet>
  <Accordion label="Example Accordion" id="ex-1">
    <p>Accordion content!</p>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion label="Acc #2" id="ex-2">
    <p>Accordion content!</p>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionSet>
```
`label` is the only required prop. `label` represents the visual heading for the modal - it can be a string, an html tag or a component.

## Without the Set
Accordions can function outside of a set as well. The set provides a convenient way to pass handlers down to all accordions if they're all in the same file.
It's possible to have accordions on their own, without an id or toggleHandler(), in which case the component controls itself via its own internal state. The downside of this is that the Accordion's collapsed/expanded state will not persist-able - it will be open by default.

```
<Accordion label="Example Accordion">
  <p>Accordion content!</p>
</Accordion>
```

## Controlled
Accordions can, of course, be controlled by state or local resource. Simply include an object with a list of keys for each accordion's `id` set to a boolean value that will be passed through to the corresponding accordion's `open` prop. This object should be passed to the `<AccordionSet>`'s `accordionStatus` prop. An `onToggle` handler will also need to be provided for proper state interaction. Passed to the `<AccordionSet>`'s `onToggle` prop, it will receive both the label and id of the target accordion, either of which could be used for additional interactions as needed.

```
import { AccordionSet, Accordion } from '@folio/stripes-components/lib/Accordion';

... // state or manifest/local resource.

this.state = {
  accordions: {
    'ex-1': true,
    'ex-2': false,
  }
}

... // Toggle handler

onToggleSection({label, id}) {
  this.setState((curState) =>{
    let newState = _.cloneDeep(curState); // remember to safely copy state! using lodash's cloneDeep() for example.
    newState.detailAccordions[id] = !curState.detailAccordions[id];
    return newState
  });
}

... // include in the jsx:

<AccordionSet accordionStatus={this.state.accordions} onToggle={this.onToggleSection}>
  <Accordion label="Example Accordion" id="ex-1">
    <p>Accordion content!</p>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion label="Acc #2" id="ex-2">
    <p>Accordion content!</p>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionSet>
```
Accordions can also be controlled outside of an accordion set... this works if you need to have different accordions of view be their own components. Simply pass the onToggle to each accordion separately.

```
  <Accordion label="Example Accordion" onToggle={this.onToggleSection} open={this.state.accordions['ex-1']} id="ex-1">
    <p>Accordion content!</p>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion label="Acc #2" onToggle={this.onToggleSection} open={this.state.accordions['ex-2']} id="ex-2">
    <p>Accordion content!</p>
  </Accordion>
```

## Rendering Summary Items and Actions in the Header.
`<Accordion>` provides two additional props: `displayWhenOpen` and `displayWhenClosed` that are used to place content in the accordion header at various states. An example of this would be summary information rendered in the `displayWhenClosed` prop, and `<Button>`'s rendered in the `displayWhenOpen` prop.
```
<AccordionSet>
  <Accordion
    label="Example Accordion"
    id="ex-1"
    displayWhenClosed={<em>3 items</em>}
    displayWhenOpen={<Button>Add item</Button>}
  >
    <ul>
      <li>All</li>
      <li>The</li>
      <li>Items!</li>
    </ul>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionSet>
```

## Custom Headers
The default header suits many cases, but if it is not adequate, a custom header can be provided via `<Accordion>`'s `header` prop. A custom header component should take `ContentId` prop in order to appropriately apply aria-attributes to the custom header. Any props passed to `<Accordion>` will also be passed to its `header` component.

## Accordion Props

Name | type | description | default | required
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
label | string, element | visible header label | | true
open | bool | open or closed | true |
id | string | unique ID to track accordion state | |
displayWhenOpen | element | content to display in header when Accordion is in the open state | |
displayWhenClosed | element | content to display in header when Accordion is in the closed state | |
onToggle | func | callback for toggling the accordion open/closed | |
header | node, func | used to render a custom accordion header | |
contentRef | func | reference function for accessing the accordion content's DOM element. | |
children | node, array of nodes | content of the accordion | |

## Expand or Collapse All
The `<ExpandAllButton>` component can be added to a stack of controlled accordions to provide a helper for performing collapse/expansions of the full stack all at once. The `onToggle` prop for `<ExpandAllButton>` takes a callback using the accordionStatus object that can be used to update the application's state.

```
// handler for ExpandAll...
  handleExpandAll(newAccordionStatus) {
    this.setState((curState) => {
      const newState = _.cloneDeep(curState);
      newState.accordions = newAccordionStatus; // substitute 'accordions' with your designated status object's name.
      return newState;
    });
  }

// in JSX
  <ExpandAllButton accordionStatus={this.state.accordions} onToggle={this.handleExpandAll} />
```
