## Properties set by Redux-form
If `<Select>` is used within a redux-form `<Field>` component (currently the most common case) then you don't have to set any of these props yourself. See the [redux-form website](https://redux-form.com/7.2.0/) for more details.

* value - Sets the selected value for the input.
* input - object - contains necessary props for the input itself such as the field's `value`
* meta - object - contains good-to-have info for the field such as `touched`

## Usage with Redux-form's `<Field>` component
In Short, `<Field>` requires a `name` and a `component` prop. The `name` is the data field and the `component` prop takes the `<Select>`. Additional props supplied are passed into the rendered `<Select>` component.
See the [redux-form website](https://redux-form.com/7.2.0/) for more information.

  fullWidth
  dataOptions={[
    {value: "Yes", label: "Y"},
    {value: "No", label: "N", disabled: true}
  ]}
/>
